- Syncs when connection restored

## Testing Checklist

### Android Testing
- [ ] App installs and launches
- [ ] All screens navigate correctly
- [ ] Location services work
- [ ] Camera functionality works
- [ ] Incident reporting works
- [ ] Alerts display properly
- [ ] Data persists between sessions

### iOS Testing
- [ ] App installs and launches
- [ ] All screens navigate correctly
- [ ] Location permissions granted
- [ ] Camera permissions granted
- [ ] Incident reporting works
- [ ] Alerts display properly
- [ ] Data persists between sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Android
- **Build fails**: Check Android SDK installation
- **App crashes**: Check device logs in Android Studio
- **Location not working**: Verify location permissions
- **Camera not working**: Check camera permissions

#### iOS
- **Build fails**: Check Xcode and signing setup
- **App crashes**: Check device logs in Xcode
- **Location not working**: Verify location permissions
- **Camera not working**: Check camera permissions

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Capacitor status
npx cap doctor

# Sync without building
npx cap sync

# Copy files only
npx cap copy

# Check plugin status
npx cap ls
```

## Performance Optimization

### Build Optimization
- Enable ProGuard for Android (minification)
- Use release builds for testing
- Optimize images and assets
- Enable tree shaking

### Runtime Optimization
- Lazy load components
- Optimize bundle size
- Use efficient state management
- Minimize re-renders

## Security Considerations

### API Keys
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables
- Restrict API key permissions
- Rotate keys regularly

### App Permissions
- Request only necessary permissions
- Explain why permissions are needed
- Handle permission denials gracefully
- Follow platform guidelines
