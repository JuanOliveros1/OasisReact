# Oasis Campus Safety App

A mobile app designed to help University of Houston students stay safe on campus. The app provides real-time safety information and tools to help students make informed decisions about their campus navigation.

## The Problem

Students often don't have access to current safety information when moving around campus. They may not know about recent incidents, dangerous areas, or available safety resources. This lack of information can put students at risk.

## The Solution

Oasis provides a comprehensive safety platform that gives students the information they need to stay safe. The app shows a map of campus with color-coded danger zones, allows students to report incidents, and provides access to safety resources and emergency contacts.

## Key Features

**Interactive Safety Map** - A real-time map showing dangerous areas on campus with different colors indicating risk levels. Students can click on areas to see what types of incidents have been reported there.

**Incident Reporting** - Students can quickly report safety incidents they witness or experience, helping to keep the campus community informed.

**Safe Walk Feature** - Students can request campus security escorts when they need to walk through potentially dangerous areas, especially at night.

**Emergency Alerts** - Real-time notifications about safety issues, weather emergencies, or campus closures.

**Safety Resources** - Easy access to campus security contacts, emergency procedures, and safety tips.

## The Vision

Oasis aims to create a safer campus environment by empowering students with information and tools. When students know about potential risks and have access to safety resources, they can make better decisions about their campus activities and routes.

The app is designed to be simple and intuitive, so students will actually use it when they need it most. By building a community of informed and connected students, we can work together to make campus a safer place for everyone.
